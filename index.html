         The tiger is the largest cat species, most recognisable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. <em>Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids</em>. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, <i>often requiring large contiguous areas of </i> habitat that support their prey requirements.
